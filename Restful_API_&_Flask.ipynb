        "**Ans 5)** o create a simple Flask application, you first need to install Flask using the command pip install flask. After installing, you create a new Python file, commonly named app.py, and start by importing the Flask module. Then, you create an instance of the Flask application using app = Flask(__name__). Next, you define a route using the @app.route() decorator, which tells Flask what function to run when a specific URL is visited. For example, defining a route for '/' (the home page) and linking it to a function that returns a message like \"Hello, Flask!\" will display that message when someone accesses the root URL. Finally, at the bottom of the file, you add if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) to run the application in debug mode, which helps with error tracking. Once this script is saved, you run it from the terminal using python app.py, and then open a web browser to http://localhost:5000/ to see your Flask app in action. This simple setup is the foundation for building more advanced web applications and APIs using Flask."

        "**Ans 17)** Flask handles static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images using a dedicated folder named static. By default, any files placed in this folder can be accessed through the /static URL path. When building web pages, developers can include these static files by linking to them in HTML templates using Flask’s url_for('static', filename='...') function, which ensures the correct URL is generated even if the application is deployed in a different environment. For example, a CSS file located at static/style.css would be accessed in the browser at /static/style.css. This built-in mechanism makes it easy to organize and serve static resources efficiently, keeping them separate from the dynamic parts of the application."
